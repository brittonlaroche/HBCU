# HBCU


## Part 1 Set up a MongoDB Atlas Cluster


## Part 2 Create a Machine learning application.

The following Hands on Lab will allow you to create your first machine learning program with nothing more than a text editor and a browser. Dpending on your familiarity with MongoDB and basic coding, the lab can be anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes in total. We chose MongoDB and Tensorflow for the ease of setup, flexibility and full set of features. Buckle up, its a fun ride!
